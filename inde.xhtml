            The first computers did not have operating systems. Each program that was running on these first computers had to include all the code needed to run on the computer,
            communicate with the connected hardware and perform the calculation that the program was intended to perform. This situation made even the simplest programs become very complex.
            In response to this problem, the owners of the central computers began to develop system software that facilitated the writing and execution of the programs included in the computer, 
            and thus the first operating systems were born.
